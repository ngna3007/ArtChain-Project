# ArtChain Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary

This project is an AI-powered NFT art platform that allows users to generate images based on an artistâ€™s unique style using Stable Diffusion integrated with LoRA models. With the help of an AI agent, users can modify Stable Diffusion settings, request explanations, and refine their prompts for better results. Once satisfied, they can mint their AI-generated artwork as NFTs on the SUI blockchain. 

The platform ensures a seamless and intuitive creative process while leveraging smart contracts to manage transactions transparently. This includes handling minting fees, fund distributions, andâ€”most importantlyâ€”automated royalty payments to artists who contribute their datasets, ensuring they are fairly compensated for their work.

- Stable Diffusion for AI-generated image creation with configurable parameters.
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to fine-tune Stable Diffusion models for customization.
- Sui Blockchain for NFT-related functionalities and Web3 interactions.
- Pinata - IPFS for decentralized storage of artwork.

#### 2.2.2. Features
- **Transaction Management**: Handle minting requests, royalties for artists, and smart contract calls.
- **Artwork Storage**: The backend triggers a minting transaction on the SUI blockchain, creating an NFT with metadata pointing to the generated image on IPFS.
- **Royalty Distribution**: Ensures that royalties are correctly distributed to the artist whenever their art style is used for minting.
- **AI-Powered Image Generation**: Users can generate art using Stable Diffusion with customizable parameters, including resolution, sampling method, and CFG scale.
- **Iterative Refinement**: The AI agent can add adjustments or improvements to generated images based on user feedback, adjusting prompts while preserving core concepts.
- **Configurable AI Settings**: Users can modify Stable Diffusion parameters such as sampling steps, width, height, and seed for precise image control.
- **AutoGen AI Agent**: An intelligent assistant guides users through AI-generated art creation, provides explanations of settings, and helps refine outputs.

### 2.3. Blockchain Layer

#### 2.3.1. Tech Stack
- **SUI blockchain**: Highly scalable and low latency.
- **The MOVE language**: Object-oriented programming language optimized for blockchain transactions.

#### 2.3.2. Features
- **NFT Smart Contract**: Manages minting, metadata (artist, style, etc.), and linking the NFT to the AI-generated image.
- **Payment Smart Contract**: Automates minting fee payments and royalty distributions when an NFT is minted.
- **Artist Registration Smart Contract** *(Planned)*: Enables artists to register their styles and track performance.

### 2.4. AI Diffusion Model

#### 2.4.1. Tech Stack
- **Stable Diffusion**
- **Hugging Face API**
- **LoRA Models**

#### 2.4.2. Features
- **Training Stage**: Fine-tunes models with specific styles of registered artists using LoRA.
- **Generation Stage**:
  - **Input**: User prompts for image generation.
  - **Output**: AI-generated images that users can mint as NFTs with embedded metadata on the SUI blockchain.

## 3. Interactions

### 3.1. Workflow Overview

|:---------------------------------:|
| *Figure 1: System Workflow* |

The workflow diagram outlines the AI-powered NFT image generator on the SUI blockchain, detailing the user journey from authentication to NFT creation and transactions.

Users begin by verifying their Web3 wallet or creating a new one. After logging in, they explore the Art Gallery and select between Premium Mode and Standard Mode for AI-generated artwork. In Premium Mode, users can refine prompts and adjust Stable Diffusion settings, while Standard Mode directly generates images with a LoRA-enhanced model.

Once artwork is created, users can mint it as an NFT. Premium users mint without extra charges, while others pay a generation fee. Approved NFTs are stored on Pinata (IPFS), with metadata passed to the smart contract for minting on SUI blockchain. The NFT is then sent to the userâ€™s wallet.

Smart contracts handle transactions, including royalty distribution and payments. After minting, users can keep or trade their NFT, ensuring ongoing engagement.

|:---------------------------------:|
| *Figure 2: AI Agent System* |

This diagram illustrates an AI agent system that processes user input to generate images using Stable Diffusion. The workflow starts with the FastAPI Server, which receives user input and passes it to Intent Classification. Based on intent, the Action Type decision node directs the request:
-	Generate Image sends the request to Stable Diffusion, which uses a LoRA Model to produce the image.
- Explain Settings provides details about Stable Diffusion parameters.
-	Update Settings modifies stored user preferences.
-	Modify Previous Image refines existing outputs using LLaMA 3.5.
-	Handle Small Talk/Error responds to casual input.
  
The Response Handler delivers results back to the user, ensuring smooth interaction and iterative image refinement.
